# Why DSA?

- It improves your logic building , time and space complexity of your code.
- Simply it helps you to make your code scallable and efficient.
- Read this blog for a general overview [Article on DevPost](https://dev.to/rahhularora/the-ultimate-guide-for-data-structures-algorithm-interviews-npo)

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  cout<<"Shahzaneer Ahmed taking on Data Structures and Algorithm";
  }
