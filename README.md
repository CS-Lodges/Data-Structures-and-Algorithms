# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
- This repository includes all the Data Structures and Algorithms I have explored till Date!

# What are Data Structures?
- The structures which are sused to store data effectively and efficiently are known as Data Structures.
# What is Algorithm?
- Step by Step solution to a proposed problem is known as an Algorithm.
# Why DSA? 
- It improves your logic building , time and space complexity of your code.
- Simply it helps you to make your code scallable and efficient.

``` cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  cout<<"Shahzaneer Ahmed taking on Data Structures";
  }
```
