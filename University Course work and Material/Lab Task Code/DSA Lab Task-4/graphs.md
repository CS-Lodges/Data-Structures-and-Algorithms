# Graph Theory
- A graph is a collection of vertices connected to each other through a set of edges.
The study of graphs is known as Graph Theory.
 

`Formal Definition`

- A graph is defined as an ordered pair of a set of vertices and a set of edges.

`G = (V, E)`

Here, V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges connecting the vertices.
