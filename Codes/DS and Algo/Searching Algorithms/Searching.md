# Searching
- It is the retrieval or checking of an element that if it exists or not exists in the Data Structure.
- There are mainly two types.

## Sequential Search
- it is like visiting the DS in a sequence and then where you find the element return its availability.
- Linear Search

## Structural Search
- it is applied on sorted DS and it is much more efficient than the sequencial search because at very point it divides the complexity into half
- Binary Search
