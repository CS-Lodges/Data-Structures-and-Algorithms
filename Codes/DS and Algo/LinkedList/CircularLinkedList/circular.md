# Circular Linked List
1. Unlike singly-linked lists, a circular linked list has no node pointing to NULL. Hence it has no end. The last element points at the head node.
2. All the operations can still be done by maintaining an extra pointer fixed at the head node.
3. A circular linked list has a head node, but no starting node.
