# AVL Tree

- AVL Tree is a balanced binary Search Tree
- It Helps in Searching
- In AVL, The Balance factor for each node is `|height of leftSubtree - height of right subtree| <= 1 `


# Why AVL?
- The Disadvantage of a skewed binary search tree is that the worst case time complexity of a search is O(height). so it does not helps us to get the advantage of BST's Binary search rather it looks like the linear Search with O(n) complexity.
- Therefore using AVL Tree we can make the use of binary search tree efficiently.

# Time Complexity
- The Search of AVL is `O(log h)` in the worst case.
