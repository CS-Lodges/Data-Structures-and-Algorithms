# Recursion
- It is the self Calling of a function and performing a big task by breaking it into smaller tasks again and again till it reaches the base condition
- Without the proper understanding of recursion It will be very more than difficult to understand `Trees`, `Graphs`, `linkedlist problems`.
- Recursion is the base for `Dynamic Programming`.
- This topic should be covered in `detail`.
- `Base Condition` is the exit condition from recursion.
