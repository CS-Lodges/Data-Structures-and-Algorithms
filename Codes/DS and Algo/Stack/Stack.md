# Stack
- Linear Data Structure
- Practical Example is the Jar Bottle of Tennis Ball
- It members follow LIFO Method (Last in First out)
- We can also call it FILO Method (first in last out)
# Implementation Ways
- Static Array
- Dynamic Array
- Linkedlist
> In any implementation note that you should use the LIFO manner.

# Application
- Functions Calls (which was discussed in Recursion)
- Bracket matching 
- Infix to postfix
- And many other operations
