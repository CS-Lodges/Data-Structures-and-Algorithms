# Queue

- Linear Data Structure
- it follows FIFO Sequence
- FIFO -> First in first out manner
- It can be implemented as Arrays , LinkedList and stack as well.

> A queue or FIFO (first in, first out) is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: enqueue, the process of adding an element to the collection. (The element is added from the rear side) and dequeue the process of removing the first element that was added. (The element is removed from the front side). It can be implemented by using both array and linked list.

```
Insertion : O(1)
Deletion  : O(1)
Access Time : O(n) [Worst Case]
```

# Important Methods

- enqueue (adding new element to the queue)
- dequeue (removing element from the queue)
- Peek (position of some element)
- isEmpty (boolean)
- isFull (boolean)
