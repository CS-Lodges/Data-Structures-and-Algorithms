//* Do switch statements check every case?
//* Based on the value of answer , the switch will jump directly
//* to the matching case and perform the statements following the colon.
//* This is more efficient than the if-statements,
//* because of the direct jumpâ€”the switch doesn't 
//* repeatedly check every possible value.
